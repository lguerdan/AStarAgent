	- error fixed (account for both obstacles in evasion logic)
	- evasion bugs fixed by correcting issue pertaining to 
	  resetting escape sequence
	- bug fixed by correcting issue pertaining to exiting
	  escape sequence at proper time
	+ Not sure why the agent follows the path that it does...
room7.txt: pass
room8.txt: pass
room9.txt: pass (?)
	+ One of several examples of the agent moving from an
	  escape space to a space along its path which is different
	  than the one it just came from, which is a behavior I did
	  not expect and can not yet fully explain...
	  
room10.txt: pass
room11.txt: pass
	- Slightly suspicious about evasion logic. Perhaps check
	  evasion logic and ensure it actually does what I think
	  it does...

room12.txt : pass
room13.txt: pass (?)
	+ Initial path planned for 3x3 room is different from
	  ones I've seen produced in other 3x3 rooms (such as 3,
	  4, 5, 9, & 12)
room14.txt: pass (?)
	- Even when allowed to travel a straight diagonal path
	  unimpeded, the agent's initial path seems to differ,
	  taking it a long way around as opposed to traveling in
	  a straight line as I would expect...

bad_room1.txt: pass
	- Everything is 1... everything.....
	+ calls input error on first line bc it's < 2
bad_room2.txt: fail
	- start:(0,1)
	+ "IndexError: index out of range"
bad_room3.txt: fail
	- finish point outside of room
	+ agent goes out of room to finish point anyway
bad_room4.txt: pass

	- everything outside of room
	+ "IndexError: index out of range"
bad_room7.txt: pass
	- obstacle and agent on same position
	+ agent an obstacle go their separate ways on the
	  first turn and no collision error is detected
bad_room8.txt: fail *****
	- stationary object on finish point
	+ infinite loop waiting next to finish point
bad_room9.txt: pass
