	- error fixed (account for both obstacles in evasion logic)
	- evasion bugs fixed by correcting issue pertaining to 
	  resetting escape sequence
	- bug fixed by correcting issue pertaining to exiting
	  escape sequence at proper time
	+ Not sure why the agent follows the path that it does...

	+ One of several examples of the agent moving from an
	  escape space to a space along its path which is different
	  than the one it just came from, which is a behavior I did
	  not expect and can not yet fully explain...

	- Slightly suspicious about evasion logic. Perhaps check
	  evasion logic and ensure it actually does what I think
	  it does...

	+ Initial path planned for 3x3 room is different from
	  ones I've seen produced in other 3x3 rooms (such as 3,
	  4, 5, 9, & 12)

	- Even when allowed to travel a straight diagonal path
	  unimpeded, the agent's initial path seems to differ,
	  taking it a long way around as opposed to traveling in
	  a straight line as I would expect...
